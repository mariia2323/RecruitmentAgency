                <p>Your task is to track the financial side of the company's work.</p>

                <p>The bureau's activities are organized as follows: the bureau searches for employees for various employers and vacancies for jobseekers. When a client-employer contacts you, his standard data is recorded
                    in the database.</p>

                <p>When a prospective customer contacts you, his standard data is also recorded in the database. A document is drawn up for each fact of satisfaction of the interests of both parties. </p>

                <p>The applicant, employer, position and commissions (bureau income) are indicated in the document. </p>

                <p>It turned out that the database does not quite accurately describe the work of the bureau. Only the agreement is recorded in the database, and information on open vacancies is not stored.</p>
